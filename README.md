## What Problem Am I Solving?

As an avid travel planner, I'm often collecting ideas and recommendations for trips which have yet to be booked. Around The Corner (ATC) is a place to log these details by location, so when ready to book, all of the time and effort is easily accessible.

## User Stories

 - As a user, I want a place to store all my plans and ideas for trips around the corner (future or yet to be booked trips), because I want all of the research and work easily available when the trip is ready to be booked.

 - As a user, I want to organize my trips by location.

 - As a user, I want to be able to add and edit new trip locations.

## Future Features

- As a user, I want to categorize activities for each location such as day trips, site seeing locations, restaurants, etc.

- As a user, I want to be able to add and edit new to-do's for each location.
