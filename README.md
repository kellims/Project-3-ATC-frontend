## ATC - Around The Corner

What problem am I solving? As an avid travel planner, I'm often collecting ideas and recommendations for trips which have yet to be booked. Around The Corner (ATC) is a place to log these details by location, so when ready to book, all of the time and effort is easily accessible.
