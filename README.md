## What Problem Am I Solving?

As an avid traveler and trip planner, I research places, tours, restaurants, and sites in locations where I don't currently have an active trip booked. Sometimes this research is to help me decide where to go, or is for a bucket list trip. Around the Corner is a place for travelers to collect this research, for easy reference when booking those trips, which (i hope!) are just around the corner.

## User Stories

 - As a user, I want a place to store all my plans and ideas for trips around the corner (future or yet to be booked trips), because I want all of the research and work easily available when the trip is ready to be booked.

 - As a user, I want to organize my trips by location.

 - As a user, I want to be able to add and edit new trip locations.

## Future Features

- As a user, I want to categorize activities for each location such as day trips, site seeing locations, restaurants, etc.

- As a user, I want to be able to add and edit new to-do's for each location.
